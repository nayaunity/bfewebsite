Last month I needed to learn a new framework for a project. Within two weeks, I was productive enough to ship features. This wasn't magic—it was a system I've refined over years of constantly learning new tech.

## The Problem with Most Learning

Most people try to learn everything before building anything. They watch tutorial after tutorial, take notes, and feel productive. But when it's time to actually build, they're stuck.

This is tutorial hell, and it's the biggest trap in tech education.

## My Learning System

### Phase 1: Quick Overview (2-4 hours)

- Read the official "Getting Started" docs
- Watch ONE overview video (not a full course)
- Understand the core concepts and terminology
- Set up a basic "Hello World" project

### Phase 2: Build Something Small (1-2 days)

- Pick a tiny project (not your actual goal)
- Build it using only official docs and Stack Overflow
- Struggle is part of the process—don't give up too quickly
- Take notes on concepts that confuse you

### Phase 3: Build Your Actual Project (ongoing)

- Start building what you actually need to build
- Learn concepts just-in-time as you need them
- Reference your notes from Phase 2
- Ask for help when stuck for more than 30 minutes

## Why This Works

Learning is not linear. You don't need to understand everything before you can be productive. You need to understand enough to start, then fill in gaps as you go.

Building forces you to confront what you don't understand. Tutorials let you passively absorb information without testing whether you can apply it.

## Tips for Faster Learning

- Read error messages carefully (they usually tell you the solution)
- Use AI tools to explain concepts you don't understand
- Join Discord communities for the technology you're learning
- Teach what you learn (tweet about it, write about it)

## When to Go Deeper

Once you're productive with the basics, then consider:

- Taking a comprehensive course
- Reading the full documentation
- Understanding the internals
- Contributing to open source

But only after you've built something real first.

## The Mindset Shift

Stop thinking "I need to learn X" and start thinking "I need to build Y using X." The technology is a tool, not the goal. Focus on what you're trying to create, and the learning will follow.

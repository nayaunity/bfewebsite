When I graduated with my Finance degree in 2020, I never imagined I'd be writing code for a living. But here I am, and I want to share exactly how I made this transition because I know so many of you are considering the same leap.

## The Moment Everything Changed

I was sitting in my cubicle, staring at yet another Excel model, when I realized something: I was automating parts of my job with VBA macros, and that was the most exciting part of my day. That's when I knew I needed to explore this further.

## My Learning Path

I didn't quit my job immediately. Instead, I started learning to code on the side. Here's what worked for me:

- Started with freeCodeCamp for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics
- Spent 2 hours every morning before work coding
- Built small projects that solved real problems I had
- Joined online communities like Twitter tech and Discord servers

## The Hardest Part

Imposter syndrome hit hard. I constantly questioned whether I was "technical enough" to call myself a developer. But here's what I learned: everyone feels this way, even senior engineers with decades of experience.

## Making the Leap

After about 8 months of consistent learning and building projects, I started applying for junior developer roles. I was rejected a lot. Like, a LOT. But I kept refining my approach, practicing algorithms, and improving my portfolio.

## What I'd Tell My Past Self

- Start before you feel ready
- Document your journey publicly (it opens doors)
- Your non-tech background is actually an advantage
- The tech community is more welcoming than you think

If you're considering making a similar pivot, know that it's absolutely possible. It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.

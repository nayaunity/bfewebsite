Let me tell you about the most profitable email I ever sent. It took me 15 minutes to write and resulted in a $25,000 increase to my offer. Negotiation is a skill, and like any skill, it can be learned.

## Why Most People Don't Negotiate

Fear. That's it. We're afraid they'll rescind the offer, think less of us, or that we're being greedy. Here's the truth: companies expect you to negotiate. They build room into their offers for exactly this reason.

## The Framework That Works

### Step 1: Get the Offer in Writing

Never negotiate verbally. Always ask for the offer in writing first. This gives you time to think and creates a paper trail.

### Step 2: Express Enthusiasm

Start your response by expressing genuine excitement about the role. You want them to know you're interested before you start negotiating.

### Step 3: Do Your Research

Use Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Blind to understand the market rate for your role. Know your number before you start talking.

### Step 4: Make Your Ask

Be specific and justify your request. Here's a template:

"Thank you so much for this offer. I'm really excited about the opportunity to join [Company]. Based on my research and conversations with others in similar roles, I was expecting something closer to [X]. Given my experience with [specific skill] and [relevant achievement], would you be able to move closer to that number?"

### Step 5: Negotiate Beyond Salary

If they can't move on base salary, try:

- Signing bonus
- Extra equity/RSUs
- Remote work flexibility
- Professional development budget
- Extra PTO
- Earlier performance review

## What Not to Do

- Don't apologize for negotiating
- Don't give a range (they'll pick the bottom)
- Don't lie about competing offers
- Don't make it personal or emotional

## The Worst They Can Say Is No

In my experience, I've never seen an offer rescinded because someone tried to negotiate professionally. The worst outcome is they say no and you still have the original offer.

Remember: negotiation isn't about being aggressive or greedy. It's about advocating for your worth. You deserve to be paid fairly for the value you bring.

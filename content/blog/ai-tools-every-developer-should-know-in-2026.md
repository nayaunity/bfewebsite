AI coding tools have exploded over the past few years, and honestly, it's hard to keep up. I've tested dozens of them so you don't have to. Here's my honest breakdown of what's actually worth your time in 2026.

## The Game Changers

### Claude Code

This has become my daily driver. What sets it apart is that it actually understands context across your entire codebase. I use it for everything from debugging to writing tests to explaining legacy code I've inherited.

### Cursor

If you haven't switched from VS Code to Cursor yet, you're missing out. The AI-first approach means features like inline editing and chat feel native rather than bolted on.

### GitHub Copilot

Still solid for autocomplete and quick suggestions. It's best for boilerplate code and common patterns. I use it alongside Claude Code rather than as a replacement.

## The Overhyped

I won't name names, but be skeptical of tools that promise to "build your entire app from a prompt." We're not there yet. AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement for understanding what you're building.

## How I Actually Use AI in My Workflow

- Code reviews: I ask AI to review my PRs before submitting
- Learning: When I encounter unfamiliar code, I ask for explanations
- Testing: Generating test cases for edge cases I might miss
- Documentation: First drafts of READMEs and code comments

## The Skills That Still Matter

Don't let AI make you lazy about fundamentals. You still need to understand:

- Data structures and algorithms
- System design principles
- How to read and debug code
- When AI is confidently wrong (it happens!)

## My Advice

Embrace these tools, but treat them as partners, not replacements. The developers who thrive will be those who learn to collaborate effectively with AI while maintaining strong foundational skills.

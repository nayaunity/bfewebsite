I get DMs every week asking how to break into tech without a traditional background. After years of helping people make this transition, I've refined my recommendations into this roadmap.

## Month 1-2: Foundations

Start with the basics. Don't skip this even if it feels slow.

- HTML & CSS: Build 5 simple static websites
- JavaScript fundamentals: Variables, functions, loops, DOM manipulation
- Git basics: Learn to commit, push, and create branches
- Command line: Get comfortable with basic terminal commands

## Month 3-4: Level Up Your JavaScript

Now go deeper:

- ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await)
- Build 3 interactive projects (todo app, weather app, quiz game)
- Learn about APIs and how to fetch data
- Introduction to React or another frontend framework

## Month 5-6: Backend Basics

Full-stack knowledge makes you more valuable:

- Node.js and Express
- Databases (start with PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- Build a full-stack project with user authentication
- Learn about RESTful API design

## Month 7-8: Job-Ready Skills

Time to polish and prepare:

- Build 2-3 portfolio projects you're proud of
- Practice data structures and algorithms (LeetCode, but don't overdo it)
- Write a technical blog post about something you learned
- Optimize your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles

## Month 9+: Apply and Iterate

- Start applying to jobs (yes, even if you don't feel ready)
- Do mock interviews with friends or online communities
- Keep building and learning based on job requirements you see
- Consider open source contributions

## Resources I Recommend

- freeCodeCamp (free, comprehensive)
- The Odin Project (project-based learning)
- Frontend Masters (paid but excellent)
- CS50 on YouTube (Harvard's intro to CS)

## The Secret No One Tells You

Consistency beats intensity. One hour every day is better than 10 hours on Saturday. Set a sustainable pace and protect your learning time like it's a meeting you can't miss.

You've got this.

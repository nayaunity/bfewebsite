Most people change jobs 5-7 times in their career. Each time you don't negotiate, the gap compounds.\n\n> \"Failing to negotiate your starting salary can cost you over $1 million over the course of your career.\" — Linda Babcock, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nThis isn't about being greedy.

Even with remote work, many companies adjust pay by location. Always research location-specific data.\n\n**Company size and stage**\nStartups often pay below market in base salary but offer equity. Large companies typically pay more in base but may have slower growth. Public companies usually pay more than private ones at similar sizes.\n\n**Industry**\nFintech and big tech pay more than non-profits or government. A product manager at a bank makes different money than one at a social media company.\n\n**Years of experience**\nBut be careful here—it's not linear. The jump from 0-3 years is huge. The jump from 10-13 years is often minimal. What you've *done* matters more than time served.\n\n**Specific skills**\nIn-demand skills command premiums. AI/ML, cloud architecture, and specialized domains often pay 15-30% above general roles.\n\n**Education and credentials**\nMatters less than you'd think in most tech roles, but can matter significantly in finance, consulting, or credentialed fields."

Should be in the 60th-75th percentile of market data for your experience level.\n\n**Stretch (Best case scenario)**\nThe high end of realistic. 85th-90th percentile. You probably won't get this, but it's useful for anchoring high.\n\n**Example:**\nMarket data shows Senior Software Engineers in Chicago make $140K-$190K.\n\n- Floor: $155K\n- Target: $170K\n- Stretch: $185K\n\nWhen asked for your expectations, you'd say a range like \"$170K-$185K based on my research of the market and my experience.\"\n\n**Never give your floor as the bottom of your range.** The company will anchor to the lowest number you mention."

Try: \"I'm researching market rates—would you be comfortable sharing a rough range for what senior engineers make at your company?\"\n\n**Check H-1B visa databases**\nCompanies must disclose salaries for H-1B visa holders. Sites like H1BGrader aggregate this public data.\n\n**Look at job postings in pay-transparent states**\nColorado, California, and New York require salary ranges in job postings.

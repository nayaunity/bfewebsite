Including everything**\nThat summer job at the ice cream shop? Probably not relevant unless you're highlighting customer service for a client-facing role.\n\n**4. Lying or exaggerating**\nDon't list technologies you've never used. Technical interviews will expose this immediately, and it's a fast way to get blacklisted.\n\n**5. Using the same resume for every application**\nTailor your resume for each role. Move relevant experience to the top. Mirror keywords from the job description.\n\n**6. Forgetting the human element**\nYes, you need to pass the ATS. But a human will also read this. Make it scannable, make it interesting, make it clear why you're the right fit."

Expertise in cloud infrastructure (AWS), database design (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), and Agile development practices. Track record of reducing system latency and improving application performance.\n\n**Keyword density matters:**\nIf a job mentions Python 5 times, you should mention it at least 2-3 times throughout your resume.

Spelling variations**\nThe ATS doesn't know that \"Javascript\" and \"JavaScript\" are the same thing. Use the exact spelling from the job description.\n\n**4. Abbreviations without context**\nAlways write out the full term at least once: \"Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\"\n\n**5. Information in the wrong sections**\nDon't put skills in your education section or work experience in a \"Projects\" section if the ATS expects a standard format.\n\n**6.

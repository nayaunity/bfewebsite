These show some creativity and independent thinking.\n\n**Tier 3: Problem-Solving Projects (High Value)**\nProjects that solve a real problem you or others have: a tool that automates a tedious task, an app that scratches your own itch, a solution to something that frustrated you. These demonstrate product thinking and real-world problem solving.\n\n**Tier 4: Technical Deep-Dives (Very High Value)**\nProjects that showcase genuine technical depth: your own implementation of a complex algorithm, a programming language or interpreter, a database or distributed system, a machine learning model trained on novel data.
